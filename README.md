Started coding, had a breakdown, bon apetit

My apologies for the incomplete project, I have lost all control! Could not organise myself time to utilise the tutor support and have suffered from taking too much on in general. That being said. I appreciate feedback and will ensure future projects are completed to a higher standard. 
I have not been able to get the javascript functioning for this project.

*Rock Paper Scissors*

This website is designed to give players a game with elements of chance. The player can choose between Rock Paper or Scissors and the computer will then challenge with its own choice. 
The final aim for the working game would be that scores would increment depending on whether the computer or the player won the game, and pictures would be displayed based on the player choice. For example if the player were to pick Rock, a hand signal for Rock would appear in the main game area. 

*Features*

*Heading*

The heading is designed clearly in large print in the center of the Screen, the font-color contrasts well with the background. 

*Game Area*

The background offers a clear difference in area and the picture displayed is relevant to the game that will be played. Image needs further styling.  

*Player options*

Buttons with icons have been used instead of words, this continues the theme from the above picture in the game-area. Icons need further styling

*Score-area*
The aim for the Score-area is that the scores will visibly increase depending on who wins the encounter, this will allow players to keep track and adds an element of competitiveness to the game. 

*Unfixed Bugs*

- Image in player area needs centering and the original aim would be that the pictures changed depending on the player choice.
- The icons for Player Choices need further styling. 
- Javascript is not correctly functioning for the project, manifested in the following ways:
        -The game buttons do not respond when clicked
        -The player or computer scores do not increase

*Deployment*

The project has been deployed to GitHub Pages.
This was accomplished by:
        - Navigating to the settings tab in Github Repository
        - Navigating to the 'pages' section 
        - Underneath the Branch heading selecting the drop down for Branch and selecting 'Main'
        - The page will then deploy and inform when this has been completed successfully.
