Started coding, had a breakdown, bon apetit

My apologies for the incomplete project, I have lost all control! Could not organise myself time to utilise the tutor support and have suffered from taking too much on in general. That being said. I appreciate feedback and will ensure future projects are completed to a higher standard. 
I have not been able to get the javascript functioning for this project.
